1) Can the output of a MALLET analysis be evidence for a particular historical position? Or is evidence too strong of a word?

2) When MALLET generates a series of topics...what are these topics? What do the words in a topic have in common, or not have in common? How should we interpret these clusters?

3) What, in your opinion, is an example of a large corpus of documents on which topic modeling would fail? By fail I mean, "not tell us anything interesting," or "the topics seem to be just random words."
